ipaddress Plugin for DokuWiki

Records IP addresses used in pages and creates lists of addresses.


Entering IP addresses:

On any page, wrap the IP address with the <IP> tag, eg:
<IP>192.168.0.1</IP>

It can optionally accept a CIDR subnet mask and/or description, eg:
<IP>10.0.0.0/16 Office network</IP>

These entries are updated in the SQLite database each time the page is saved.

Displaying IP addresses:

Use the <IPList> tag to display a range of IP addresses in a table, with links to the pages that contain them, eg:

<IPList 10.0.0.0 10.255.255.255 />

will not work!
